A computer engineering undergraduate student at Bursa Uludag University.
In the first year of university, I dealt with image processing thanks to [İTÜRO](http://www.ituro.org/tr/kategori/trafik/).  
I develop [projects]({{< ref "projects" >}}) to gain experience in software, coding.

In December 2020, I decided to deal with cybersecurity.
I am trying to have basic knowledge of many subjects, but I work more defensive security because I am interested in.
By using the _[GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy)_ operating system in daily life, I am improving my knowledge day by day.
By following new information and technologies closely, I try not to stay behind the agenda and even to give direction to that agenda. I gain new knowledge and experience about servers.

In the future, I aim to work in _SOC_, _security analyst_ units on _defensive security_.
